<h1>***** HTML *****  <strong> <-- H1 define the main heading or title of a webpage's content</strong> </h1> 
<p> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages and their content for display in a web browser. 
    It is considered the fundamental building block of the web, working alongside Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. 
</p>
<h3>Key Concepts --> </h3>
<p><strong>* Hypertext: </strong> Refers to the system of links that connect web pages to one another, allowing users to navigate between related documents and websites by clicking.
</p>

<p><strong>* Markup: </strong> Involves using a series of elements, known as tags, to annotate or "mark up" content (text, images, etc.) to define its structure and meaning (semantics). The browser interprets these tags as instructions on how to display the content, rather than displaying the tags themselves.
</p>

<p><strong>* Semantic HTML: </strong> Semantic elements use tags that define the role of the content within them. This provides structural clarity, which is crucial for accessibility (screen readers), <em>search engine optimization (SEO) </em>, and code maintainability. 
    Tag are <strong><em>"header", "nav","article", "section","footer","strong" and "em" </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>* Non Semantic HTML: </strong> Non-semantic elements are generic tags used for structure and presentation, but they do not add any additional meaning or context to the content they wrap. They are primarily used as styling hooks for CSS or for layout purposes when no suitable semantic element is available. 
Tag are <strong><em> "div","span"</em></strong>,<i>"i(Italic)"</i>,<b>"bold"</b></p>

<h2>H2- tag defines secondary headings or subheadings within a webpage's content.</h2>
<h3>H3- tag defines level-3 type headings within a webpage's content.</h3>
<h4>H4- tag defines level-4 type headings within a webpage's content.</h4>
<h5>H5- tag defines level-5 type headings within a webpage's content.</h5>
<h6>H6- tag defines level-6 type headings within a webpage's content.</h6>
<p><strong>* In line elements: </strong> An inline element in HTML is an element that does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as is necessary for its content. The tags
    "header", "nav","article", "section","footer","strong" and "em" in-line elements.
</p>
<p><strong>* Block elements: </strong>A block-level element in HTML always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available within its parent container
    "h1,h2,h3,h4,and so on ", "p" tags are Block level elements</p>

<h3>** List item **</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dhaka</li>
<li>Chittagong </li>
<li>Cumilla</li>
<li>Khulna</li>
</ol>
<p> There are two types of list in HTML</p>
<li>Un-order list, it declared by tag name like <strong><em>"ul"</em></strong></li>
<li>Order list, it decleared by tag name like <strong><em>"ol"</em></strong> </li>    

<h3 style="color: blueviolet;font-style: italic;">*** Division Tag *** </h3>
<p style="margin: 20px; border: 30px;padding: 30px;"> The HTML "div" tag, short for "division," is a generic container used to group other HTML elements together for styling and layout purposes. It is a block-level element, meaning it typically starts on a new line and takes up the full available width of its parent container by default. 
</p>
<button><strong><em> click me </em></strong> </button>
<h3>*** Break tag *** </h3>
<p>The HTML "br" tag (break tag) is used to insert a single line break within a block of text. It is an empty, or void, element, meaning it does not require a separate closing tag.
